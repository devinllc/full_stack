# GitHub Push Instructions

Since you've already removed sensitive credentials from your current code and replaced them with environment variables, you need to authorize GitHub to allow the push that contains those credentials in the history.

## Option 1: Authorize the secrets via GitHub URLs

Visit each of the following links and click "Allow" to permit GitHub to accept the push:

1. Google Cloud Service Account Credentials:  
   https://github.com/devinllc/fmg_flstc/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2v2zYjjLyQGmDBPvKiLCpYm3sS4

2. Amazon AWS Access Key ID:  
   https://github.com/devinllc/fmg_flstc/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2v2zYlfTU6wGLMglcUVSapi8Sei

3. Amazon AWS Secret Access Key (1):  
   https://github.com/devinllc/fmg_flstc/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2v2zYlaySKEN8BH3RMqqWKj9Quc

4. Amazon AWS Secret Access Key (2):  
   https://github.com/devinllc/fmg_flstc/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2v2zYjSOGTNwc31O2pCW8KbQayz

After clicking "Allow" on all the links, try pushing again:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Force push an empty repository first

If Option 1 doesn't work, you can create a new repository without the credentials:

```bash
# 1. Create a temporary directory
mkdir -p ~/temp_new_repo
cd ~/temp_new_repo

# 2. Initialize a new Git repository
git init
touch README.md
echo "# File Manager" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# 3. Add your remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/devinllc/fmg_flstc.git

# 4. Force push this empty repository
git push -f origin main

# 5. Now go back to your actual project and add your files
cd /Users/vramesh/jobss/filemanager
git add .
git commit -m "Add project files with credentials removed"
git push origin main
```

## IMPORTANT: Revoke the credentials

Since these credentials were exposed in a public repository, you should:

1. Revoke and replace the AWS access keys
2. Regenerate the Firebase service account credentials
3. Revoke the Google Cloud credentials

This is necessary even if you've removed them from the code, as they existed in the Git history and could have been compromised.
